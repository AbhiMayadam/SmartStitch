## What is SmartStitch?
A small yet powerful program for stitching together webtoons/manhwa/manhua raws then slicing them down to the whatever size you wish for.

The smart part of the name comes from the fact that it uses some simple pixel calculation to stop itself from cutting/slicing through sfx or speech or drawings. it making life much easier for the team working on those raw images. [Both CLRD and TS will thank you a lot].

*It's not fancy, and does not use AI, but it's fast, robust, simple and more importantly works for me. (So i decided to share it with you!)*
